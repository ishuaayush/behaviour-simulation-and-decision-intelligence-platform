# Human Behaviour Analytics 🧠📊

An industrial‑grade behavioural analytics system built from scratch for learning, research, and teaching.

This project combines concepts from:

* *Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques* — Jiawei Han
* *Fluent Python* — Luciano Ramalho

The goal is to understand data science deeply by building a real analytics platform instead of only using libraries.

## 🚀 Project Vision

We are building a system that simulates and analyzes human lifestyle behaviour patterns:

sleep → energy → productivity → mood → habits → predictions

Instead of analysing static datasets, this project creates a **living dataset** using a virtual human behaviour generator and then mines patterns from it.

This mimics how real analytics companies build systems internally.

## 🤝 Collaboration (Open Learning Project)

This is a collaborative learning project — not just a code repository.

You can join if you want to:

* learn real data science beyond tutorials
* understand algorithms conceptually
* practice Git workflow
* contribute even as a beginner

You DO NOT need to know everything before joining.

Learning happens inside the project.
